                     <p>Adapting a successful UK credit and report app (20+ million users) for the Canadian market. My role involved leading in-depth user interviews and usability testing in Toronto. These efforts were aimed at gathering critical insights on usability, functionality, and overall user experience. Through this process, I identified and addressed key market-specific challenges, ensuring the app’s interface and features resonated well with Canadian users. This initiative not only tailored the app to a new audience but also set a strong foundation for its success in Canada.</p>

                <p>Partnering closely with the founders of an early-stage startup to enhance the user experience and interface of an innovative app designed for Gen Z investors. My role was to develop a comprehensive design system and refine the UX/UI, which had been primarily founder-led up until that point. The app delivers investment insights through TikTok-style short videos, appealing directly to the preferences of a younger audience. I ensured that the platform was both engaging and intuitive, facilitating a seamless user journey that aligns with the quick consumption habits of Gen Z.</p>

                <p>As Head of Design at Ziglu, the first crypto app to hold regulatory registration in both the UK and Europe, I developed the complete design system and led a focused team to create an intuitive app that democratises cryptocurrency trading. Our mission was to make the complex world of crypto accessible to the mass market. The app combines cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange trading alongside traditional banking in one user-friendly platform. This approach not only attracted over 100,000 users within months of launch but also earned us the UX/UI Award at the CryptoAM Awards</p>
